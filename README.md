[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/bennythejudge/frontend-nanodegree-resume.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

work started downloading the code from udacity
i worked several days before setting up github, changing the remote origin URL
to my own, and doing the first commit and push

31/10/2014
smaller changes to change the styling of the header just a little bit
had to change both the template part delivered by udacity, the styling and the
code.
in particular, at a friend's suggestion, I experimented with dt/dd
I also made the contacts, github and email, in links to the relative item.
